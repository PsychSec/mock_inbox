    Imagine that you are Alex Carter, an executive director of a fictive company
    called Anneon.<br /><br />

    Your task in this study is to process Alex' e-mails as you would do as an
    executive director.<br /><br />

    You will see a simulated version of Alex Carter's Outlook inbox.<br />
    It contains 47 e-mails that need to be handled adequately:<br /><br />

    You need to select one of the e-mails and then any of the available options
    that you find applicable. The options are similar to what you would
    typically find in your Outlook e-mail inbox:<br /><br />
    <ul>
      <li><b>Reply</b>: allows you to reply to the sender of the e-mail</li>
      <li>
        <b>Forward</b>: allows you to forward the e-mail to your executive
        assistant to take care of it
      </li>
      <li><b>Archive</b>: will move the e-mail to an archive</li>
      <li><b>Delete</b>: will delete the e-mail</li>
      <li>
        <b>Junk</b>: will mark the e-mail as junk and move it to the junk folder
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    When you are done processing all e-mails, click "DONE":<br /><br />
